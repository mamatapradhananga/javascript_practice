/* 
- Variables are heart of every programming language
- They are used to store information
*/

// In Js Define variable with keyword var

var

/*
- Then variable name
- variable name can contain letters,numbers,underscore but cannot start with number
- good practice to write variable name in camel case
*/

var myName2 //correct variable name
var 2myName // incorrect variable name

// Variable value: 2 ways to assign value to a variable

var myVariable;
myVariable = 12;

// OR

var myVariable = 12;

// 


/*
- Just like a language has nouns, verbs, and prepositions, JavaScript has its own building blocks. 
- Instead of calling them building blocks, however, developers call them data types.
- There are three essential data types to know for now
	String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".
	Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
	Boolean: This is always one of two words. Either true or false, with no quotations.
*/

int myNumber = 40; // in other language, you need to define the data type of variable

//But in Js has dynamic types. A variable values can change to string,number,boolean
// there is no need to specify the data type of variable like in other programming language

var myString = "Mamata";
var myNumber = 27;
var myBoolean = true;
