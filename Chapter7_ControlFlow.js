/*we're going to take our first look at control flow - if statements. If statements are alive everywhere you look in the world. If you perform an action, there will be a corresponding reaction or result. This concept is used in programming too.


If statements can be used to check a variety of things in JavaScript, such as whether a certain element has a particular class associated with it, or to check if an element is showing on a web page. They're an extremely important aspect of JS, and will be VERY helpful in your future coding!*/
