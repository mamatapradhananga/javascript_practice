What is javascript?

HTML: controls structure of your webpage
CSS: controls the presentation/design
Javascript: adds behaviour and interactivity

- JavaScript is a scripting language. This essentially means it is limited in functionality - but this is the way it was made, intentionally! 
- It's primary purpose is to add functionality and interactivity to websites, such as banner sliders, zoom-galleries, drag and drop etc. Is great at manipulating web pages


- JavaScript is what's known as a client-side language, meaning it runs on your computer and not on a web server. - It cannot communicate directly with a database or file system on a compute. There are exceptions to this (e.g. with Node.js) but this is generally the case.
- Other programming languages such as PHP, run on the server and are called server side languages.

- JavaScript should enhance your audienceâ€™s experience only
- Do not rely on JavaScript to add core functionality to your website
